Project for the Pattern Recognition & Analysis course (The University of Queensland).

The goal was to implement a U-Net to perform image segmentation of MRI scans of the brain, using TensorFlow and Keras.

I developed the U-Net working on Google Colab, since it offers free GPU runtimes to speed up the training of the model.

The Python code in this repository is just a direct export of the Jupyter code.
